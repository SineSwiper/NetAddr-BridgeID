NetAddr::BridgeID - Object for BridgeIDs (priority/MAC combos)

=head1 SYNOPSIS

   use NetAddr::BridgeID;
    
   my $bid;
   $bid = NetAddr::BridgeID->new( '2#00:11:22:aa:bb:cc' );
   $bid = NetAddr::BridgeID->new( bridge_id => '60#0011.22AA.BBCC' );
   
   use NetAddr::MAC;
   my $mac = NetAddr::MAC->new( mac => '0011.22AA.BBCC' );
   
   $bid = NetAddr::BridgeID->new( priority => '60', mac_obj => $mac );
   $bid = NetAddr::BridgeID->new( priority => '60', mac => '0011.22AA.BBCC' );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This object class simply creates a L<NetAddr::MAC>-like object, with a priority for
STP Bridge IDs.

=for Pod::Coverage BUILDARGS

=head1 METHODS

=head2 original

The original bridge ID string, as it was passed to the constructor.  If it was passed
in pieces (or if parts were left out), it will fill in the gaps to provide a full
bridge ID

=head2 bridge_id

The bridge ID, with a Cisco-style MAC address (like C<0000.1111.2222>).

=head2 priority

The priority number.

=head2 mac_obj

The L<NetAddr::MAC> object tied to this one.

=head2 NetAddr::MAC Methods

All of the C<is_* / as_* / to_*> methods are "handled" to the main BridgeID object, so 
you can access them directly.
